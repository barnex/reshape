PACKAGE

package reshape
    import "github.com/barnex/reshape"

    Converts between 1D arrays (like []float32) and mulit-dimensional arrays
    (like [][][]float32), while sharing underlying storage.

    This is often needed when passing multi-dimensional arrays as contigous
    lists to, e.g., C code.

FUNCTIONS

func C3(array []complex64, size [3]int) [][][]complex64
    Re-interpret a contiguous array as a multi-dimensional array of given
    size. Underlying storage is shared.

func ContiguousD3(block [][][]float64) []float64
    Reshape the block to one contiguous list. Assumes the block's storage is
    contiguous.

func ContiguousD4(block [][][][]float64) []float64
    Reshape the block to one contiguous list. Assumes the block's storage is
    contiguous.

func ContiguousR3(block [][][]float32) []float32
    Reshape the block to one contiguous list. Assumes the block's storage is
    contiguous.

func ContiguousR4(block [][][][]float32) []float32
    Reshape the block to one contiguous list. Assumes the block's storage is
    contiguous.

func D3(array []float64, size [3]int) [][][]float64
    Re-interpret a contiguous array as a multi-dimensional array of given
    size. Underlying storage is shared.

func R3(array []float32, size [3]int) [][][]float32
    Re-interpret a contiguous array as a multi-dimensional array of given
    size. Underlying storage is shared.

func R4(list []float32, size [4]int) [][][][]float32
    Re-interpret a contiguous array as a multi-dimensional array of given
    size. Underlying storage is shared.

func SizeofD3(block [][][]float64) [3]int
    Assuming the input has a block layout, return its size.

func SizeofD4(block [][][][]float64) [4]int
    Assuming the input has a block layout, return its size.

func SizeofR3(block [][][]float32) [3]int
    Assuming the input has a block layout, return its size.

func SizeofR4(block [][][][]float32) [4]int
    Assuming the input has a block layout, return its size.

func Z3(array []complex128, size [3]int) [][][]complex128
    Re-interpret a contiguous array as a multi-dimensional array of given
    size. Underlying storage is shared.
